# Experimental version of OptiKey for conducting gaze typing experiments.

The 'Experimental version of OptiKey' project (this project) is a modified version of [**OptiKey**](https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey/wiki) specifically developed for performing gaze typing experiments with OptiKey.

With the experimental version of OptiKey, you are able to specify the parameters of your gaze typing experiments, perform the experiments with OptiKey, and have the program log important data such as which buttons is being looked at with milliseconds precision, or eye tracking data such as pupil diameter while typing. This information is logged into .CSV format files, which can easily be analyzed after conducting experiments.

In the image below, you can see the parameters you are able to specify:

The settings you specify in the ExperimentMenu are saved automatically, so that you can perform multiple experiments with the same saved settings.

Clicking "START EXPERIMENT", in the bottom of the window will start the experiment:

During the experiment a user types in phrases shown cyan, e.g. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" as shown in the image above. 

The program logs which phrases are shown for the user together with a time stamp:

The program also logs which keys the user activates:

What is written into the scratchpad in blue, e.g. "The quick brown fox jum":

And also which screen elements the user looks at:

Right now the experimental version of OptiKey works with a mouse, and the same eye trackers that works with OptiKey. Gaze tracking data can however right now only be logged when using the EyeTribe Development Kit. However we are working on supporting other trackers as well.

# Getting Started

You can get a manual for the experimental OptiKey project here: [**Manual on the experimental version of OptiKey**](https://github.com/PeterOeClausen/OptiKey/raw/master/Manual/Manual%20on%20the%20experimental%20version%20of%20OptiKey.pdf).

# Supported Platforms

OptiKey targets the .Net 4.6 Framework, which is available for  Windows Vista SP2 onwards. It was designed to run on Windows 8/ 8.1/ 10.
